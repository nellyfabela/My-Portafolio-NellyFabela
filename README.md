# Bootcamp Challenge 02 - Nelly Fabela

## Description

This challenge allowed me to create a website from scratch making me think about all the ways it can be done and how small details are the difference in the structure of it. It was challenging and took me two types of format to eventually get to the one that worked best for me, using "block" to identify the information that needed to be in the website. As mentioned in Challenge1 this was also an opportunity for trial and error in repetition. I was very happy when the outcome came as the demostrated mock-up, morivating me to make some changes in details, type of letters, colors, etc. 

## Installation

For this Challenge I used mainly Terminal, GitHub, VS Code and an internet browser. 

## User Story

The challenge indicates the desires to accomplish:
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Usage

The website must look like this in order to accomplish the Acceptance Criteria and make it as the Mock-Up:
